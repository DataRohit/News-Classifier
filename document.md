To approach the problem of building a news classifier application, the steps would follow the flow of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline, where the task is to collect data (news articles), process it, and categorize it into predefined categories. Below is a detailed explanation of the approach to implement each component, aligned with the assignment deliverables.

### **1. Understanding the Requirements**

The assignment requires the development of an application that:
- Collects news articles from various RSS feeds.
- Stores the data in a relational database without duplication.
- Classifies the news articles into predefined categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Utilizes a task queue for asynchronous processing.
- Handles logging and error management.

The deliverables include:
- Python code for the application.
- Documentation explaining the logic and design choices.
- Resulting data in an exportable format like `sqldump`, `csv`, or `json`.

### **2. Designing the Solution**

Based on the assignment details, here is how I would approach the problem:

#### **2.1 Feed Parsing and Data Extraction**

##### **Objective:**
Collect news articles from multiple RSS feeds.

##### **Steps:**
- **Choose Libraries**: Use `feedparser` to read and parse RSS feeds.
- **Extract Key Information**: Extract the `title`, `content`, `publication date`, and `source URL` from each article.
- **Avoid Duplicates**: Ensure that articles are not duplicated by checking the `title` or `source URL`.
  
##### **Design Choices:**
- **Handling RSS Feeds**: Each feed will be parsed in parallel to minimize latency.
- **Deduplication Logic**: This can be achieved by maintaining a set of URLs or titles that are checked before storing data in the database.

#### **2.2 Database Storage**

##### **Objective:**
Store the extracted articles in a relational database like PostgreSQL.

##### **Steps:**
- **Choose Libraries**: Use `SQLAlchemy` to interact with the database and define the schema for storing articles.
- **Schema Design**: The schema would include:
  - `id` (Primary Key)
  - `title` (Unique)
  - `content`
  - `publication date`
  - `source URL`
  - `category` (for classified articles)
  
##### **Design Choices:**
- **Preventing Duplicates**: Articles with the same title or source URL should not be inserted again. This can be done by checking for existing entries before inserting.
- **Efficient DB Operations**: Use bulk inserts for efficiency if parsing large volumes of articles.

#### **2.3 Task Queue and News Processing**

##### **Objective:**
Set up asynchronous processing for parsing and classification using Celery.

##### **Steps:**
- **Task Queue**: Use `Celery` with Redis as the message broker to handle background tasks asynchronously.
- **Article Processing**: Once articles are fetched, they should be sent to the Celery queue for further classification.
  
##### **Design Choices:**
- **Parallelism**: Asynchronous task processing allows parsing and classification to happen concurrently, reducing waiting time.
- **Celery Workers**: Set up Celery workers to process tasks in the background, avoiding bottlenecks in feed parsing.

---

#### **2.4 Article Classification (NLP)**

##### **Objective:**
Classify each news article into predefined categories.

##### **Steps:**
- **Choose Libraries**: Use `spaCy` or `NLTK` for natural language processing.
- **Category Mapping**: Articles need to be classified into categories like "Terrorism", "Positive/Uplifting", "Natural Disasters", and "Others".
- **Rule-Based or ML-Based Approach**:
  - **Rule-based approach**: Use keyword matching based on the content to determine the category.
  - **ML-based approach**: Optionally, a pre-trained model could be used for classification. However, keyword-based classification would suffice for this task.
  
##### **Design Choices:**
- **Scalability**: The chosen method should allow the addition of more categories and keywords.
- **spaCy**: spaCy is lightweight and easy to use for tokenization and keyword matching. For the given assignment, keyword-based classification should be sufficient.

#### **2.5 Logging and Error Handling**

##### **Objective:**
Implement logging to track events and gracefully handle errors.

##### **Steps:**
- **Logging**: Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module to track feed parsing, database operations, and classification.
- **Error Handling**: Ensure proper handling of potential issues, such as:
  - Network connectivity issues when fetching RSS feeds.
  - Database connection issues.
  - Unforeseen errors in Celery workers.
  
##### **Design Choices:**
- **Graceful Failures**: If an error occurs, log it and allow the application to continue running without crashing.

### **3. Implementation Steps**

1. **Set Up Project Structure**:
   - Follow a modular structure with separate components for feed parsing, database interaction, task queue management, and classification.
   
2. **Feed Parsing**:
   - Implement `feedparser` to pull data from the list of RSS feeds.
   - Ensure deduplication and handle errors like malformed feeds.

3. **Database Schema Design**:
   - Use `SQLAlchemy` to define the schema and handle insertions.
   - Create a unique constraint on titles or URLs to prevent duplicates.

4. **Article Classification**:
   - Use `spaCy` to analyze the content of each article and classify it based on predefined categories.
   
5. **Set Up Celery for Task Management**:
   - Configure Celery to handle article processing asynchronously.
   - Define separate tasks for parsing feeds and classifying articles.

6. **Logging and Error Handling**:
   - Implement logging for key processes and ensure proper error handling.

7. **Write Tests**:
   - Write unit tests for feed parsing, database storage, and classification to ensure each component functions correctly.

### **4. Technology Stack**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `feedparser` for parsing RSS feeds.
  - `SQLAlchemy` for database interactions.
